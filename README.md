### An analysis of New York Times articles' headlines' use of Covid-19-related terms from December 2019 to December 2022.

This project uses an app I built using the New York Times API to scrape article metadata from December 2019 to December 2022 and then conduct simple analysis of the use of covid-realted terms over that time period.
